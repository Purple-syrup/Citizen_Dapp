#
> ## Problem Statement
~ Transparency in Decision-Making: Existing DAO 
governance frameworks often lack transparency, 
hindering community trust and participation in crucial 
decision-making processes.
~Inefficient Delegation Processes: Delegating voting
power within DAOs is often inefficient and opaque, 
leading to suboptimal outcomes and disenfranchising
stakeholders from the decision-making process.
#
> ## How it works
***Note:*** <b style="color:orange"> Effortlessly create a community for your DAO,create proposals and define the metrics and conditions,members can vote,delegate and participate actively by making their decisions onchain ...</b>

#
> ## Technologies Used

 | <b><u>Stack</u></b> | <b><u>Usage Summary</u></b> |
 | :------------------ | :------------------------- |
 | **`Base OnChainKit`**       | Base smart wallet, smart contract calls, transactions       |
 | **`Base chain`** | Main contracts deployed/diferent dao voting logic |
 | **`Solidity`**      | Smart contract             |
 | **`React`**         | Frontend                   |

- ### **Solidity smart contracts**
    Citizen makes use of the different voting smart contracts of the daos that list their products on our platform, on listing the provide their contract ABI, Function name and contract address which we would use with base onChainkit to interact with the vot function in their contracts


- ### **Base Chain**
    - The Dao contract are <b style="color: orange"> to be deployed on</b> this chain 


- ### **Base OnChainKit**
    - <b style="color: orange">The Base OnChainkit</b>  was used to handle our base smart wallet, contract interaction and transaction functions.

#
## Features we couldn't complete
- we could not finish ...
    >we wanted to finish a stable backend to track, collect and register Daos but still working it out <b style="color:orange">Thankfully we are still on our toes building it</b>

#
## Future Project Plans
We plan to push this project further after the hackathon, and integrate some features we werenâ€™t able to complete. 
- <b style="color:orange">Firstly</b> Our mission is to ensure Transparency in Decision-Making of Existing and new DAOs in the space </b>
.</b>
- <b style="color:orange">Improved Community/Dao voting/proposal publicity and awareness among Dao anfd non Dao members</b>
